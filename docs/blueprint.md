# **App Name**: CipherChat

## Core Features:

- Message Input: Allow users to type and input their messages.
- Scramble Generation: Generate a scrambled version of the message based on a user-selected method. This feature should use the LLM as a tool; depending on the user request, the LLM might incorporate emoticons in its response.
- Display scrambled Message: Display the scrambled message in an output box.
- Copy Scrambled Text: Enable users to copy the scrambled text to the clipboard.
- Scramble Method Selection: Allow users to choose different scrambling methods (e.g., letter substitution, reverse)

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and security.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and readable interface.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) for interactive elements and highlights to create contrast and grab attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, should be used for a clean, modern and readable look.
- Use minimalist icons for actions like copy, and scramble. Icons should be simple, clear and easily recognizable.
- Use a clean, single-column layout. Input field at the top, followed by the scrambled output. Action buttons should be clearly visible and easily accessible.
- Subtle animations when the scramble action is completed (e.g. the output box smoothly fades in the newly scrambled text.)
