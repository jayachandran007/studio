The key principle is Authorization Independence, achieved through path-based ownership and avoiding `get()` calls in security rules. Data is segregated to ensure each collection has a homogeneous security posture, simplifying rules and improving maintainability. \n\nUsers are stored at the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring only the authenticated user can access their data.  Messages are stored within a subcollection `/users/{userId}/messages/{messageId}`. This structure enables straightforward security rules based on path ownership, ensuring that only the sender and recipient have access to a message's content.\n\nThis design supports the QAPs (Rules are not Filters) by ensuring that `list` operations can be securely performed within the `/users/{userId}/messages` collection, as access is determined by path-based ownership."
