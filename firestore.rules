/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CipherChat.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-centric security model where users can only manage their own profiles
 * and have access to messages sent to or from them. The rules leverage denormalization of senderId
 * and receiverId within the message documents to ensure authorization independence and efficient queries.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with the document ID matching the user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores chat messages associated with a user, both as sender and receiver.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, update, or delete their own user documents.
 * - Users can only access chat messages where they are either the sender or the receiver.
 * - List operations on messages are restricted to the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Chat messages include both 'senderId' and 'receiverId' to allow direct authorization without additional reads.
